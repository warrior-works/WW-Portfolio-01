**Where’s your home?**

Is it where you were born?  
Is it the street where your childhood ran barefoot?  
The house with old photographs and smells you still remember?

**Maybe once, yes. But not always.**

*Because life moves.  
And so do we.*

Today, most of us aren’t living where we started.  
We’re scattered ∿
in cities far from our roots,  
in countries our families have never stepped foot in,  
in time zones that feel like a different world.

>We’ve moved for studies.  
>For jobs.  
>For business.  
>For love.  
>For survival.

And in those moments ⚡︎ standing on strange streets, sleeping in unfamiliar beds, walking into new schools or workplaces 💭 a thought always comes:

 **This isn’t home.**

But here’s a truth we often overlook:  

**Home isn’t always something you return to.  
Sometimes, it’s something you build ⟡ moment by moment, wherever you are.**

---

✦ If you’re a student living in a city 1000 kilometers from your family…

When you leave college at the end of the day, where do you go?

⟢ You don’t say **I’m going to my hostel** or **my PG** or **my flat.**  
⟢ You say, *“I’m going home.”*

That rented room with posters taped to the wall.  
That mug you always drink chai in. ☕︎  
The grocery shop uncle who knows your favorite chips.  
The city that once felt strange now knows your steps.

Even your college ⚝
with its worn out benches and noisy corridors 𖹭  
starts feeling like home.

**Not because it’s permanent.  
But because you’re present.  
And that presence makes everything familiar.**

---

✦ If you’ve moved away for a job…

That 1BHK apartment with a creaky bedframe and leftover pizza boxes?  
That’s your home too.

Your desk cluttered with dreams and deadlines 𓍼  
is more than just a workspace.  
It holds the weight of your ambition, your long nights, your resilience.

You come back to your apartment after a long day,  
change into your comfortable clothes, sit near the window,  
and for a moment, you exhale .☘︎ ݁˖  
and that’s home.

Even the local chai tapri ☕︎ near your office,  
the security guard who nods when you walk in,  
the 10 minute walk you take after work to clear your mind ✧  
they’ve become your things.

*They’re the little things that ground you,
the moments that steady you,
the quiet proof that you belong.*

---

✦ If you’re building something ⚡︎  
A business, a brand, a dream 💭  
then your workspace becomes more than just walls and Wi-Fi.

Your office, your studio, your co-working desk   
becomes your second skin.  
The place where you take risks, where ideas are born,  
where you face failure, frustration, and tiny victories.

To every founder, every entrepreneur, every creator:  
> You’ve made a home inside your hustle.

Because it’s where you grow.  
It’s where you believe, even when no one else does.

**Home isn’t just comfort.  
It’s not always cozy, or perfect, or full of people.**

Sometimes, home is the silence after the struggle.  
Sometimes, it’s the one bowl of hot food you eat at midnight.  
Sometimes, it’s the playlist you play on loop because it helps you feel less alone.

> Home is the feeling of returning to yourself.  
> Even in the middle of chaos.  
> Even when everything around you changes.

You don’t have to go back to find home.  
Sometimes, you just have to pause… and realize you’ve been carrying it with you all along.

> Because home isn’t just a location.  
> It’s a feeling.  
> It’s a rhythm.  
> It’s a belonging.  
> And most importantly 𖹭 *It’s you.*

You’re the home of your memories ⚝ the ones that randomly make you smile.  
You’re home for all the adventures you’ve taken, for all the mischief you’ve done.  
You’re home for every tear cried in secret, and every morning you woke up stronger.

The places you’ve seen, the photos you’ve taken, the people who’ve left fingerprints on your soul 𓆩♡𓆪  
You carry them all.  
You are the only place they truly return to.

---

**So when you feel like you don’t belong to the world around you…**

**Pause.**

**Because maybe you’re not meant to belong to the world.  
You’re meant to belong to yourself first.**

*To your own story.  
To your journey.  
To your truth.*

**✦ So where’s home?**  
It’s not always the town you left behind.  
Not always the house with your childhood name on the door.  
Not always four walls and a nameplate.

Sometimes, it’s the corner table in a noisy café where you work.  
Sometimes, it’s a tiny flat lit with fairy lights.  
Sometimes, it’s your journal, your laptop, your voice.  
And always ⭑𓂃 always ⭑𓂃 it’s you.

> Home is not a destination.  
> It’s a presence.  
> And it’s where you are.

Zindagi ik safar thi, magar khwab sa nahi tha,
Har kadam par thahraav tha, par hisaab sa nahi tha.

Deewaron mein kya dhoondhte ho 'aashuu', ghar to ehsaas tha,
Jo rooh mein basa tha, wo pyaas sa nahi tha.

Har ajnabi shehar mein tu apna sa kyon laga,
Teri hansi mein koi rasta tha, deewaar sa nahi tha.

Pyar auron se to kiya, par sukoon na paaya,
Jo khud se mila hoon main, wo nayaab sa nahi tha.

Chalte rahe hum talaash mein kisi manzil ki,
Jo mila apne andar, wo kharaab sa nahi tha.

Ab jo ruk ke dekha to samjha hoon main 'aashuu',
Ghar to wahi tha, jo mere saath chala, wo pata sa nahi tha!!
