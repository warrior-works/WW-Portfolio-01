*Where’s your home?* It’s where you are

You’re your home for memories that randomly make you smile.  
You’re home for all the adventures you’ve taken, for all the mischiefs you’ve done

Home for all the nights you’ve cried, and the mornings you woke up stronger

> The places you’ve seen, the photos you’ve taken, all those people who have touched your heart, you’re home for all those and more

You might feel like you don’t belong to the world around you right now

But guess what?

You’re not meant to belong to the world, or the people around you.  
You just need to belong to yourself first, and be your own true self

Home. It’s in you, **it’s where you are**

Zindagi se yahi gila hai mujhe  
Tu bohat derr se mila hai mujhe..

Hum safar chahiye hujoom nahi  
Ik musafir bhi qafila hai mujhe

Tu mohabbat se koi chaal to chal  
Haar jaane ka hoslaa hai mujhe..

Kya khabar maine chahaton mey Faraz..  
Kya ganwaaya hai kya mila hai mujhe!!
